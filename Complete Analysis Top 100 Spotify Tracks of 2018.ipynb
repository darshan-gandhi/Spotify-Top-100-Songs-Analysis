This year's playlist (Top Tracks of 2018) includes 100 songs. The question is: **`What do these top songs have in common? Why do people like them?`**\n\n**`Original Data Source:`** The audio features for each song were extracted using the Spotify Web API and the spotipy Python library. Credit goes to Spotify for calculating the audio feature values.\n\n**`Data Description:`** There is one .csv file in the dataset. (top2018.csv) This file \n\n**`includes:`**\n\n* Spotify URI for the song\n* Name of the song\n* Artist(s) of the song\n* Audio features for the song (such as danceability, tempo, key etc.)\n* A more detailed explanation of the audio features can be found in the Metadata tab.\n\n**`Exploring the Data:`** Some suggestions for what to do with the data:\n\n1. Look for patterns in the audio features of the songs. Why do people stream these songs the most?\n2. Try to predict one audio feature based on the others\n3. See which features correlate the most\n\n**`NOTE:`** *At the end of this notebook you will be providing the conclusions of the study*"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# import libraries "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns \nfrom scipy.stats import pearsonr\n%matplotlib inline ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df=pd.read_csv('../input/top2018.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**We make the conversion of the column duration  to place it in standard format (minutes:seg )**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df['Duration_min']=df['duration_ms']/60000","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.drop(columns='duration_ms',inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Identification of correlations between columns.\n\nIn this step we will help you with the `corr ()` function of pandas and then we will make a heat map that will clearly show the correlations between certain columns, although the ideal thing before this step is to have an idea of ​​the columns that will have a possible correlation."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.heatmap(df.corr(),cmap=\"YlOrRd\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**ANALYSIS:** We can observe in the strongest tones the existing correlations between the different columns, at first glance the `\"loudness and energy\"` columns call our attention but our duty is to explore the behavior of each one of the variables."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Top 10 artists with the largest presence in the Top 100"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df['artists'].value_counts().head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Danceablity column analysis"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.set_style(style='darkgrid')\nsns.distplot(df['danceability'],hist=True,kde=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**ANALYSIS:** In this graph we can see that most of the tracks are considered danceable from values ​​higher than 0.5, but to make a better analysis we are going to divide them into 3 groups:\n\n* Greater than 75% --- Very danceable\n* between 50% and 74% -
